# What is Version Control

## What is Git

- A software designed to track the history of the code (known as version control) of a project. 

- Facilitates reproducibility and collaboration. 

- Designed originally for software development, but widely used in the research community today. 

- With GUIs (GitHub Desktop) the learning curve decreased and benefits started to exceed the costs. 

**G**raphical **U**ser **I**nterface   

## What is Git

- Git understands any type of plain text file (`myfile.R`, `myfile.do`, `.tex/.md/.txt/.csv/.etc`).

- Files that are "not trackable" are called binary files (`myfile.docx`, `myfile.xlxs`, `.pdf/.exe/.dta/.etc`).

- Git can see the updated versions of binary files, but it cannot track or show the changes made in them.

## What is Github

  Github provides two services: 
  
- A web hosting service for all our files that we track with git (Public files are free, private files are free only for academics). 

- A GUI software (Desktop App) that provides user friendly access to git.

## Why to Use

**1:** To keep track of all the important modifications to your code.  

**2:** To learn how to collaborate with others using Github.   

## Conventional Method:  

1 - Agree on a naming convention with your co-authors (eg: filename_date_INITALS).  
2 - Always work from the last saved version (eg: `workshopcode_20181002_OB.do`).  
3 - After your changes, save a new version (eg: `workshopcode_20181003_TB.do`).  

Easily adopted but:    

Lots of files for each document, hard to see changes of your own and others, hard to track the time of changes, errors, and time costs.     

## Example

## Github

1 - Name your file `filename` (ideally `01_filename`).
2 - Whenever you complete a relevant change and sync, Git takes a snapshot of your work.
3 - Git keeps updating your entire folder in the cloud. Thus, it is visible to your collaborators too.   
Harder adoption but: 

One file per document, track differences across all versions, easily follow when others make a change, easily follow the time of changes. 

## Additional Benefits

- Collaborate in others' open access projects (e.g. R packages). 
- Find collaborators for your own projects. 

# Exercises

## Three Exercises

1 - **Work on a solo project**.  

2a - Copy and work on another person's project. 

2b - Send an edit suggestion to the other person's project. 

3 - Collaborate with another person in a project.    

## Exercise #1

We start on Desktop.

-  Click **File** and **New Repository**.   
-  Name it **My-First-Repository** and check "Initialize this repository with a README" (Not required but usually a good idea). Find the location of the new repository folder in your computer.
- Click **Publish repository**. Now your repository is online on Github.com. 
- You can visit your online repository by clicking **Repository** and **View on Github** in the menu. 

## Exercise #1
-  Drag any text file to your repository folder.  
-  Type "My first changes" in your text file. 
-  Check the GitHub Desktop. You will see the change you just made. Click **Commit** to confirm your change. (You can edit and commit as often as you like, GitHub Desktop will memorize all the changes you committed but they won't appear online until you push.)
- Click **Push** to see your changes online. 

## Three Exercises

1 - Work on a solo project.  

2a - **Copy and work on another person's project**. 

2b - Send an edit suggestion to the other person's project. 

3 - Collaborate with another person in a project.    

## Exercise #2a

We start in the Cloud.

-  Sign in your [github.com](github.com) account.   
-  Find the repo **tugbabozcaga/GitHub-Tutorial**.   
-  **Fork** the repo (You could also simply clone or download, but fork for this one because we'll send a pull request to the repository owner later.).  
-  Now click **Clone** and **Open in Desktop**. Now you have downloaded your fork to your desktop too.   

## Exercise #2a

Now we are on Desktop.

- You will see a window with the button **Clone** in your Github Desktop, click it. 
- A folder named **GitHub-Tutorial** has been downloaded to your computer. Find it. 
- Open the Birthdays.R file. Type your birthday. Save.
- Go to GitHub Desktop. You will see the change you just made. Click **Commit** to confirm your change. 
- **Push**.Now if you visit your own Github-Tutorial fork (youraccount/GitHub-Tutorial), you will see all the changes you made through GitHub Desktop.

## Three Exercises

1 - Work on a solo project.  

2a - Copy and work on another person's project. 

2b - **Send an edit suggestion to the other person's project.**

3 - Collaborate with another person in a project.      
    
## Exercise #2b

Now you made changes in this other person's project but they only appear in your fork! You want to send her your suggestions/revisions.

- Now that you confirmed that your online GitHub-Tutorial fork reflects all the changes, you can click **Pull Request**. 
- Click **Create Pull Request**. Type a short summary explaining your change in the title of the box that emerges, and click **Create Pull Request** again.
- The owner of the repository will click the following options to accept your changes: **View the Pull Request**, **Merge Pull Request**, and **Confirm Merge**. That means now all your changes have been added to the original folder.

## Three Exercises 

1 - Work on a solo project.  

2a - Copy and work on another person's project. 

2b - Send an edit suggestion to the other person's project.

3 - **Collaborate with another person in a project**. 

## Exercise #3

Pair up with a neighbor. One of you be A and one be B for this exercise. You can work with your **My-First-Repository** folder.

- A: In the settings tab for A’s repository on Github.com (that A published above), add B as a collaborator.
   
- B: Accept the invitation, and clone A’s repository so that you have it in your own computer. 

The rest is the same as working on your solo project.

- B: Now make a change, e.g. "Edit 1 by Collab B", commit, and sync (push) the change.

- Switch roles between A & B and repeat.

## Tips 
- When you collaborate, you may not want to work in the master branch. You can instead create an experimental branch by clicking the **Current Branch** menu, **New Branch**, and then **Create Branch**. This way we'll make sure we can't directly push the changes and can send create a pull request so that person A will see our changes as well. Person A will see the change and merge the pull request. 
- If you are collaborating, always sync before you start a new session of work. Also good to sync before pushing.    
- You don't have to push every hour, but commit often (<1hr)  
- Think of your remote as the most important set of files. Get used to deleting things in your local machine.
